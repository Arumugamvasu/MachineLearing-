Oil price detection using Random Forest in Python 


Crude Oil prediction using Random forest algorithm with scikit learn.
    This Python Script mainly describe the basic data pre processing and modelling and testing using scikit learn  package.


 Crude Oil Dataset:
           I am using manually collected dataset. It is represent oil supply ,oil demand ,weather condition depend on oil production timing  and monthly oil price variations.   
Setup:
make sure to have the latest python version ( 3.6) installed in your machine. Then additionally need to install the scikit learn lib(sklearn),pandas,matplotlib packages.

Process:
•	Read the dataset 
•	pre-processing process.
•	scaling steps
•	Build Random forest model
•	Find Confusion Matrix
